# Learning Go — Daily Practice Series

Welcome to my public learning series for the Go programming language. The goal of this repository is to learn Go from scratch, build a solid foundation, and share my daily progress in a clear, reference-friendly way.

## What This Repo Covers

- Fundamentals: syntax, packages, modules, and tooling
- Core concepts: types, variables, constants, control flow, functions
- Idiomatic Go: formatting, error handling, and code organization
- Small runnable examples per topic, each in its own folder

## Folder Structure

- `hellloworld&simplevalues/`: First steps in Go — printing output and working with simple values (strings, numbers, booleans).
- `variables&constants/`: Declaring variables and constants, type inference, and best practices.

Each folder contains a `main.go` with focused examples. Read the folder’s README for a quick overview and run instructions.

## How To Run Examples

Prerequisites: Go installed and available in your PATH.

- Navigate to a folder and run the example:

  ```powershell
  cd "D:\my\GUNJAN\Gunjan Go\learning\hellloworld&simplevalues"
  go run main.go

  cd "D:\my\GUNJAN\Gunjan Go\learning\variables&constants"
  go run main.go
  ```

## Learning Approach

- Incremental progress: I add small, well-scoped examples daily.
- Clarity first: Each example is documented and easy to run.
- Practical focus: Emphasis on understanding by doing and following idiomatic patterns.

If you’re learning Go too, feel free to explore the code, run the examples, and use these notes as a reference.
